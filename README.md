## About Jam Sessions

Jam Sessions is inspired by Tinder, but with a twist: finding local *musicians* to jam with. The application provides dynamic searching with respect to prospective jammers' instrument, proficiency level, years of experience, and distance away. Upon mutual matching, real-time messanging can be initiated by both parties to initiate the jamming. Will you find bandmates for the next big chart topper? Find out on Jam Sessions!
